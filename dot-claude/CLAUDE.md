- If running tests, prefer to run only specific failed tests first and fail on the first broken test. Only once all are passing should you run all the tests. e.g. `make rspec a_spec.rb:123 --next-failure`
- If committing, NEVER use `git add .`, when committing ALWAYS commit specific files, e.g. `git add file1.js file2.js`.
- If running commands, prefer to use `Makefile` commands or `npm run scripts`.
- If creating a PR, use `gh pr create -d -w` to open the web browser afterwards and in draft mode by default.
- If deleting a file, instead of `rm -rf`, use `rm` which moves files or directories to Trash
- If committing, NEVER NEVER NEVER disable signature verification. if committing fails or times out, just pause and ask me to sign.
- if using `if` or conditionals or for/each/etc loops, use early return / next where it improves legibility.
- if writing an `if` statement in ruby, dont use `unless`.
