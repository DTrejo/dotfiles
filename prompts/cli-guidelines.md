# CLI guidelines
- Ruby script
- `-h`, `--h` help message
- on start, check for CLI deps and print install instructions if not present and exit
- `popen3` like `run()` for command execution to prevent shell escapes
- `debug()` print statements throughout the code that are enabled with DEBUG=1
- `-t`, `--test` to run the tests
- at least one minitest for each function if possible
- at least one end-to-end minitest
- example CLI tools: `which draft` `which issue`
- usually we want defaults that allow us to run the script without arguments
- validate arguments for security
- use `OptionParser` for argument parsing
- `main` is the entry point
