# DTrejo's Dotfiles

Some of my dotfiles. Feel free to browse. I recommend copy-pasting rather
running the install script, so you know what's going on.

Run

    # git clone this repo
    cd dotfiles
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh

to install.

## What it looks like

# What will it do?
- install my ~/.profile, ~/.gitconfig, and ~/.gitignore
- move your own versions of scripts into backup files
- install command line tools from npm that I find handy
